        "Efficient thermal insulation": "Panels with EPS or PIR core offer excellent thermal insulation, reducing the need for air conditioning and promoting energy savings. PIR, with low thermal conductivity (0.022 W/m.K), is ideal for projects that require high energy efficiency, while EPS provides excellent cost-effectiveness.",
        "Aesthetics and customization": "With pre-painted galvalume steel coating (white RAL 9003 or other colors upon request) and smooth, ribbed or micro-ribbed finish options, Isoart panels allow aesthetic customization to meet the architectural needs of each project, ensuring a modern and functional look.",
        "Fast and economical assembly": "The modular system with male-female interlocking facilitates installation, reducing construction time and labor costs. The lightness of the panels minimizes the need for heavy equipment, optimizing transport and logistics at the construction site.",
        "Sustainability and durability": "Resistant to corrosion, Isoart panels guarantee long service life with minimal maintenance. The use of pentane as an expansion agent in PIR ensures environmental compliance, without HCFC emissions, meeting the Montreal Protocol."
