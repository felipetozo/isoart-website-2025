        "Structural load relief": "The lightness of EPS significantly reduces the self-weight of the slab compared to traditional systems, which relieves the load on foundations, pillars and beams. This enables more efficient and economical sizing of the entire structure, resulting in lower consumption of concrete and steel. Additionally, it allows spanning larger spans with fewer support elements, optimizing the project and contributing to more rational construction execution.",
        "Construction savings": "EPS slabs offer savings in various areas: materials, time and labor. Assembly is simpler and more agile, requiring fewer professionals on site. Transport of pieces is facilitated by low weight, both horizontally and vertically. The reduction in the use of wooden forms, concrete and steel also directly impacts the budget, making the system more competitive and sustainable, without compromising structural performance.",
        "Project flexibility": "With production to measure, EPS slabs adapt to different construction needs, both in height and width and length. Their structure facilitates the creation of paths for electrical and hydraulic installations, and can be shaped with simple tools or thermal blowers. This eliminates the risk of damaging the concrete cover, as occurs in ceramic systems, and allows adjustments without compromising slab integrity.",
        "Intelligent thermal insulation": "In addition to acting as an excellent thermal insulator, EPS contributes to more adequate concrete curing. It prevents loss of mixing water, maintaining moisture for longer and improving slab resistance after concreting. The result is a more stable and durable structure that provides thermal comfort to the environment and reduces the need for artificial air conditioning - which directly impacts the building's energy consumption."
